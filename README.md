## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
     
     1). clone this project into your pc or laptop
     2). try to download proffesion version of Pycharm (optional).
     3). import the project in your editor like Pycharm.
     4). Now we need to creat virtual environment for running our project and deployment it on the www.pythonanywhere.com .
     5). Go to the terminal in your Pycharm only and run the following mentioned command
         
         $ python3 -m venv myvenv
         
         The virtual environment was not created successfully because ensurepip is not available.  On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you need to install the python3-venv package using the following command.
         apt-get install python3-venv. You may need to use sudo with that command.  After installing the python3-venv package, recreate your virtual environment.
         
         In this case, follow the instructions above and install the python3-venv package:
         
         $ sudo apt-get install python3-venv
         
         NOTE: If you get an error like
         E: Unable to locate package python3-ven
         
         then instead run:
         $ sudo apt install python3.6-venv
         
         #Working with virtualenv
         Start your virtual environment by running:
         
         $ source myvenv/bin/activate
         
         #Installing Django
         
         (myvenv) ~$ pip install --upgrade pip
         (myvenv) ~$ pip install django~=1.11.0
